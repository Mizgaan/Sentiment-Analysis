       "  \"Zack Snyder's Justice League is one of the best-made and most successful DC films without a shadow of a doubt, thanks again to His Highness Zack Snyder. The visionary director manages, through the undaunted and determined flow of fans with the #releasethesnydercut movement, to bring his spectacular vision of the Justice League, presenting a spectacular film with parsimony and dedication, as only a true DC fan can do. Not only the film is deepened with a wealth of filmed material that no one ever imagined existed, but it manages to redeem itself and to fight with tight fists the previous Justice League (2017) which was a total and a colossal flop in every aspect (not Snyder's fault, of course). In this Snyder Cut all the questions that the Theatrical Cut did not give are answered, digging into the background of the characters and giving valid reasons where it seemed everything was thrown into turmoil and even randomly placed; moreover, the full potential of Snyder's direction is expressed through his unique and particular shots, also implementing and improving both CGI and cinematography, which are the perfect accompaniment to the director's vision. The four hours of the Snyder Cut are nothing more than a blaze of beauty towards these heroes, where with the old release seemed all too strange that they (production & co.) had offered so little from such a talented and resourceful director. Recall that the Snyder Cut must be contextualized and must be interposed in a timeline that had precedents and sequels in the DC Extended Universe, but now it is all to be reviewed, all to be rewritten, all to be reset. This film, as well as citing a similar case (although not entirely), namely The Godfather III Coda, totally redeems the film, putting everything in a new light, entrancing both fans and insiders and in doing so recreating a films from 0 (in fact much of the Theatrical Cut material is not present), bringing to light aspects never seen before and better set together and doing so, finally, being meaningful. Commendable and mouth-watering movie to learn more and that opens up worlds as well as in DC comics. Bravo Zack Snyder, Bravo. Justice has been served for the Justice League.\"],\n",

The pacing of the movie is excellent so much so that it doesn't seem like a 4 hour movie.If Marvel fans want to compare pacing lets just say being a neutral comic book fan myself the pacing can be compared to The Winter Soldier which is one the best movies too. Each characters motives including the antagonist are clearly portrayed and the story telling is so compelling that u feel for those characters. CGI is great in many scenes but only in some scenes are where u can have a lacking sense but overall it was good. This movie actually feels like a compelling story of a comic book rather than its predecessor which felt like a popcorn movie. It had a great beginning and a end where u want more of it and the character development was excellent throughout. A Great movie for the fans who waited for years and a good compelling story driven movie for the neutral comic book audience .\"],\n",

Ohhh dear...yup...we\\'re in for quite a ride. So with Superman dead, Batman and Wonder Woman must arrange a team of gifted individuals to stop the world destroyer Steppenwolf from, you guessed it, destroying the world.

Apprehensively, I went into this unmotivated and expecting the worst superhero film since Suicide Squad. Fortunately, this isn\\'t that bad. But, it\\'s not great either. The film\\'s greatest achievement is the coalition of the Justice League members. Their interactions, mannerisms and even their physicality was pretty much on point. Aquaman, although absolutely useless in this, had the physical prowess of a beastly underwater warrior. The Flash was quirky and provided several comedic moments. Cyborg was essentially the technological logistics manager. Wonder Woman and Batman were the parents who lead their children into battle. Heck, she even refers to them as children! Yet it all worked so well. Remember, this is a comic book adaptation, so the humour and light hearted nature of its source material does show. The human CGI for the most part was actually executed well (far better than \"Thor Ragnarok\") and the slow motion scenes with The Flash were gorgeous to watch. Snyder is typically style over substance, which is apparent here. The story is so boringly uninspired that it defines the word \"lazy\". I cannot be dealing with another \\'save the world\\' situation. I\\'m also becoming irritated with underused, bland and weak villains who are supposed to be absurdly powerful. Steppenwolf was wasted potential. Constant use of green screen, hit and miss script, rushed third act...just too many flaws I\\'m afraid. Was it too soon for a Justice League film considering no origins for Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg yet? Personally, I think so.'],\n",

This level of \"nothing new\" is damaging to the story as it stops you from caring about anything. And it seems like the producers knew this cause they threw in the mandatory helpless family so that you could sense the danger a bit more. After all, it\\'s just the end of the world, how could you care if there was no kid in immediate danger ? Oh wait... Still, even that falls flat as their scenes (and they\\'re not the only ones) are filled with incoherent behaviors that were put there just so that the plot can go forward.\\n\\nI attended a screening where the only bursts of joy (or emotions at all) occurred when a new character appeared. Kind of a \"fanboy effect\" that fills you with hope at the sight of one of your beloved comics characters. But the rest of the time, everyone was quite bored and numerous sighs were heard. In a sense, it reassured me as I understood I was not the only one who was disappointed in the movie.\\n\\n*****The following paragraph might contain a minor SPOILER (depending on what you consider a spoiler)*****\\n\\nPlus, something else bothered me. But I know everyone won\\'t agree on this one cause it\\'s kind of a speculation. All the points above still stand even if I\\'m wrong about it. So here it is : Justice League felt like it was a failed attempt to adapt the Avengers in the DCEU. And I\\'m not talking about the strangely similar theme. Nor am I referring to the tension inside the team before they reconcile that felt like a watered-down version of what we saw in the 2012 movie by Whedon. But the characters are bent so that they match their Marvel counterparts. The Flash takes the place of the slightly weaker and wisecracking Hawkeye, Aquaman clearly corresponds to Thor with his royal and out-of-place persona, Wonder Woman goes through the same soldier- leader dilemma as Cap did and even Batman is slightly changed so that he\\'s closer to Tony Stark (making decisions that make absolutely no sense for the world\\'s best detective that we all know and love). That\\'s a shame cause DC characters are interesting and have a lot more to offer than a mere copy.\\n\\n*****END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER*****\\n\\nAs of 11/16/2017, this movie has an 8.1 score here on IMDb. Now I\\'m not a hater and won\\'t say it\\'s the worst movie in history but more than 8 ? Seriously ? It barely does the job so it\\'s a 5 out of 10 for me.'],\n",

Of the new cast Miller is a fine addition as the awkward Allen, Jason Momoa gives fans hope that his standalone Aquaman will be a lot of fun, while it\\'s surprising just how affecting Ray Fisher is as Cyborg even if his character doesn\\'t seem cut out to get his own standalone feature.\\n\\nIt\\'s a shame then that we don\\'t ever feel like this team is given the scenarios they needed to really gel together. There\\'s chemistry to be found here, even Cavill and Affleck benefit from the likes of Gadot and the new additions, their rather tiresome portrayals enlivened by the fresh, energetic nature of their co-stars but overall the film lacks an energy or pizazz that would\\'ve been the kicker to elevate this genuine middle of the road experience to something else entirely.\\n\\nFinal Say –\\n\\nAll in all huge fans of DC will be kept happy with this sometimes enjoyable, sometimes downright bad big screen culmination of hero\\'s and one badly CGI\\'d and generic villain.\\n\\nDevoid of anything of true note and without a memorable set-piece, Justice League is unquestionably the poor cousin of The Avenger\\'s but with the talented cast involved, there is enough hope here to suggest that this band of hero\\'s have some room to grow into something special if all the stars align.\\n\\n2 1/2 terrorised Russian families out of 5'],\n",

       "  \"There is so much wrong with this movie, it's difficult to know where to start.\",\n",
       "  \"Let's start with the most obvious weakpoint: the villain. Steppenwolf is a laughably bad villain, ripped straight out of a 90ies direct-to-DVD film. He is just a big bland CGI character with absolutely no personality whatsoever. He has no motivation other than being the generic evil guy trying to destroy the world. Apparently it's not even hís plan. If I understood correctly, he's the henchman for some other character that we never learn anything about. His entire design was just uninspired, and he looked and sounded more like a weaker version of the Beast from the live action Beauty and the Beast than one of the strongest characters in the world, hellbend on creating destruction.\\n\\nThen there are the problems with the entire way that DC is approaching these movies. Making this an ensemble movie, just like with Batman v Superman, feels entirely unearned and a cynical attempt to cash in on the widespread brand recognition of Batman and Superman, and to a slightly lesser degree Wonder Woman, and of course the success of Marvel. It's really hard to look at this film and not conclude that this is DC's failed attempt at creating their version of The Avengers.\\n\\nHowever, whereas The Avengers' meetup felt natural, having been build up throughout its previous 5 movies, Justice League decides to introduce half of the entire league in just this movie. This makes most of the first half of the movie an uneven and boring bunch of random character introductions. Only Wonder Woman and the segments on Themyscira felt natural, because we were already introduced to their culture before and therefore had some connection to them.\\n\\nThe rest of the Justice League itself is also lackluster. Jason Momoa's Aquaman was kinda interesting, but it once again feels incredibly cynical that they would introduce the character in this movie instead of in his own one, just because they knew that it would be hard to get people excited for an Aquaman standalone movie without an introduction to the character first. They don't care that it's to the detriment of the quality of this movie, it's just a way too get people to buy into a future film, exactly as they did with Wonder Woman. In this case they actually would have done well to look at Marvel, as they were able to introduce obscure and silly looking/sounding characters like Ant-Man and the Guardians of the Galaxy in standalone movies, and make it a critical and commercial success.\\n\\nCyborg was just boring and uninteresting. He has no personality, there's nothing to his character, because there was not enough time for a proper introduction. Even his suit is making the decisions for him sometimes. The CGI was also quite distracting, as his face looks rather fake.\\n\\nAnd of course while The Flash has been around for a long time, I find it hard to believe that they would have introduced his character the way they did without the success of Spider-Man in 2016's Civil War. He's pretty much an exact copy of Spider-Man, playing the teenage boy that is overenthuastic about being a superhero, and deriving humor from that.\\n\\nThey even found a way to make Batman look uncool. He's pretty much just collecting the team for most of the movie, and does very little on his own. What is most disappointing is that Ben Affleck is never really Bruce Wayne. Whenever you see him dressed normally on screen, it's just him doing Batman stuff without his suit on. Even Wonder Woman has a scene of her being Diana Prince, but it's all only Batman throughout.\\n\\nThen there's Superman, whose return was very poorly done. First of all, if you have a character that is supposedly dead, don't make the actor's name the second one to pop up on the opening credits. That's a surefire way to ruin any potential surprise about his return. Of course that return was inevitable and obvious, but at least put in a little bit of effort to hide that fact. I don't even have to put in spoiler tags in here because DC doesn't even consider his return a spoiler.\\n\\nSecondly, because his return was so quickly - halfway through the chronological follow up to the movie in which he died - there is absolutely no relief or emotional climax to his arc, or any sense of urgency, really. You never really care that Superman's death has supposedly thrown the world in disarray, because his death barely has had any time to have resonated with the viewers. Hell, his supposed death didn't even make it through the end of the previous movie without some hint of his upcoming return.\\n\\nIf they had some patience and balls, they would have had him stay dead for a few films, preferably those in which the rest of the Justice League got introduced, and in which the threats get increasingly challenging and hard to overcome due to Superman's absence. This way when he finally does return after the rest of the League is facing a truly frightening and unstoppable enemy, his come-back would feel earned.\\n\\nOverall, there's so much wrong with this movie that although I wrote so much, there are still many flaws left untouched (like Zach Snyder being Zach Snyder doing too many Zach Snyder things, or the nonsensical process of resurrecting Superman that actually put them in more danger than before). It's amazing that after the disaster that was Batman v Superman, they went pretty much the exact same route for its follow-up, setting up an illogical and unearned conflict and resolving it in a cliched and nonsensical manner.\\n\\nAt least Batman v Superman had some really cool action scenes instead of the uninteresting CGI fest that was Justice League. And while Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor was a terrible villain, I'd take him over the soulless CGI monstrosity that is Steppenwolf any day of the week. Justice League is a terrible movie in every regard, and really does not bode well for the future of DC's cinematic universe.\"],\n",

My review doesn't comes out as a pure hate machine but rather due to the epic disappointment of one might feel after waiting for so long to witness the most epic team up quite possibly of this century to turn into a mediocre generic film.\\n\\nThis should've been the most epic saga in DCEU's continuity but alas rushing to compete with Disney finally took a toll on this franchise. The characters are well enough on their own but their development as individuals are rather paltry. The cinematography is awkward at times as evident from multiple re shoots done by Joss Whedon.\\n\\nThe CGI in some parts are terribly glaring to avoid and it feels too much green screen effect that makes your head hurt while watching in a dark room. Some are too bright while some are too dark. The color grading is very inconsistent with the background. As you all know Superman returns from the dead (which is kinda given at this point) but his resurrection isn't handled well enough. What should've been the rekindling of the hope people lost like the Rebirth of a Phoenix is marred by botched character interactions and idiotic dialogues.\\n\\nThe supporting characters such as Mera, Martha Kent and Alfred are wasted even further. One of the most highlighting parts of BVS was the interactions between Alfred and Bruce engaging in both morally and logical decisions. Sadly it's been reduced to banal banter between them and others. I'm not going to highlight the humor since it's overdone and doesn't fit organically in this film narrative. Humor is good and should be present but not forced and overstuffed like Disney films recently have become.\\n\\nThe villain is generic along with musical score by Danny Elfman which is just rehashing of the same old stuff. Wait for the 4K or bluray release to see edited scenes as consistent with DC's film which might be better.\"],\n",

The acting by Tom Holland and the rest of the cast was very well done. I've read reviews with titles saying if you're a veteran you're going to be angry. But again, this is based on a real life account of an Iraq veteran dealing with his PTSD after coming home to Cleveland.

And remember this is very close to a true story, written by a man who fell down the darkest of holes having been failed by the systems and freedoms he swore to protect.\\n\\nCherry is just an ordinary guy. There's nothing remarkable about him. And the disordered start of this film (which I struggled with to be honest) reflects the erratic nature of his drifter existence.\\n\\nAs the film progresses the style falls into order and then back into disorder, reflecting the rollercoaster ride of Cherry's horrific wartime experience and descent into drug addiction as he struggles to erase what he saw. The Russo Brothers together with DOP Newton Thomas Sigel, use a range of clever tricks to put you in Cherry's boots. From colour tones to aspect ratios, it takes you from soft warm love to cold hard conditioning in an instant.\\n\\nI personally really enjoyed these choices, and look forward to watching it again to see what other details I might have missed on first viewing. I understand some people might feel that there's too much movie going on, but it was more than fine for me (all personal taste I guess!).\\n\\nThe acting from Tom Holland is exemplary and, at times, frightening. I cannot think what it must have been like to have to go to those places to portray the pain and fear he did and he should be applauded for taking such a leap with this role - he will always carry the weight of Spider-Man on his shoulders but he should be at least respected for wanting to branch out into challenging roles such as this. Ciara Bravo was excellent too, although I think I would have liked a bit more character arc from her (not her fault of course). I thought the supporting cast did well too in their roles - none of them particularly likeable (Jeff Wahlberg's Jimenez a rare exception) as they support and enable Cherry's demise.\\n\\nOverall, this is a movie which really stayed with me, it still does.

       "  'Wow.\\n\\nI don\\'t know where to start with this movie really. It was everything and the kitchen sink.\\n\\nI will start by saying that the actors did a fantastic job. They were all believable and really sold these characters. I think without them this movie would honestly be unwatchable, they really deserve credit.\\n\\nThe rest of it is something else.\\n\\nThe best way I can sum up the direction is, you know that person that thinks they are smarter than everyone in the room and they keep trying to convince you that they are the smartest. This movie is that person.\\n\\nThe directing doesn\\'t let you just sit and watch the movie. It is constantly shouting in your face being like \"look over here isn\\'t this the best thing that you have ever seen?\" And it just isn\\'t. Breaking the forth wall isn\\'t something new. Using different lighting to spot light something isn\\'t groundbreaking but this movie wants you to think that it is. It is honestly so distracting and takes away from the story.\\n\\nThis also goes for the score. It was so annoying and out of place and once again it was screaming in your face.\\n\\nThe pacing and runtime were also an issue. 2 hours 30 is a long runtime for any movie but I don\\'t think this story had enough to support that. It had drawn our scenes and lingering shots that just bogged it down. I also think that half of this movie is shot in slow motion. It was just constantly happening for no reason other than to show off.\\n\\nThe other biggest disaster of this movie is the narration. It\\'s is literally like they had Tom Holland read action lines from the script. It was just like \"I\\'m in a bar and the bar is red and there are people here, it\\'s 3 o\\'clock but soon it will be 4 and then I will go home but first I poured a drink and then I drank it\". Why include that, it is utterly pointless. It isn\\'t a radio programme, we have eyes. Just show us what is happening we will understand it.\\n\\nAnd I think that once again comes back to this movie thinking it is insanely clever. It thinks the audience are idiots so they need spoon feeding ever piece of information.\\n\\nIn someways I appreciate that they took swing and tried a different approach, I think they just needed to give the audience more credit. It is a well made film it just is so over produce and over directed to the point were it. Ruins the whole thing.'],\n",
